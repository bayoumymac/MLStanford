# **Machine Learning Stanford**

### **Example Problems**:

* Database Mining using large datasets to turn records to knowledge through discovering otherwise hard to find patterns and insights
* application that can'rt be programmed by hand otherwise data with hard to find patterns ie
  * flying a helicopter
  * handwriting recognition
  * NLP
  * computer vision

### **what is Machine Learning?**
* Arthur Samuel (1959) Machine Learning is field of study that gives computer the abiity to learn without being explicitly programmed ie 
  * arthur samuel's checker's model that learned how to play checkers through playing aganist itself

* Tom Mitchel (1998). Well posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T as measured by P, improves with experience E
  * ie experience of Arthur samuel checkers model would be playing itself for tens of thousands of hours
  * the task would be playing checkers
  * performance would the probability of winnning the next game of checkers aganist some player

### **Machine Learning Algorithms**
* Supervised learning
* Unsupervised learning
* Reinforcement learning
* recommender systems

### **what is supervised learning?** 
* regression problems
  * housing price prediction, 
* classifications problems
* a model that depends on infinite features
